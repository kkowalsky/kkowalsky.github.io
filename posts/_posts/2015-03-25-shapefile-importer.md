title: Shapefile Importer GUI for PGAdmin3 (for mac)
---
I had been struggling to add the Shapefile importer tool to PGAdmin3 for a PostGIS database we're working on in my class but I figured out an alternative! <em>As an aside, the shp2pgsql command line is totally great &amp; amazing, but I wanted to have a GUI for when I want to be extra careful.</em>

I downloaded the <a href="http://boundlessgeo.com/solutions/opengeo-suite/" target="_blank">OpenGeoSuite</a>Â from Boundless Geo and if you have the postgres.app and pgAdmin3 installed (which is the setup I definitely recommend for Mac), when you open the geosuite, you can click on the utilities:

Which shows this:

![pgadmin 2](../../../../assets/img/blog/pgadmin2.png)

The pgShapeLoader should be pulled in your applications folder and ta da! it's installed.

Open the ShapeLoader to set up your connection details, which if you're unsure about, can be copied almost word for word from PGAdmin3.

Then click add files...

After adding the file you can edit the SRID, the Geo Column, etc.

I've had no problem with this at all, but if it doesn't work I recommend just using the command line.

QGIS has an option for this of course built in through their SPIT tool (and has a bunch of great data management tools in general that I'll explain in the future)
