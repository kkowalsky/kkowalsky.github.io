**About**

This project, completed in Adobe Illustrator and QGIS, was completed for a client during my time at the UW-Madison Cartography Lab. The client wanted a simple map of the Indochina region, with Laos as the main focus to show where the National Protected Areas are located for an academic journal. In order to make a simple and clean looking map for my client, I decided to only use black and white and used drop shadowing and waterlines to add some dimensionality.
