**About**

I made this map of unemployment map of the US as a challenge in an advanced cartography course at UW-Madison. The exercise required each student to design the map using a different, assigned artistic/emotional inspiration. I had the emotion of "excited" so I created the map using the most exciting graphic design style I know: comic art. This map challenges the notions of what typical moods should be used on a certain topic but doesn't necessarily reflect my personal views on unemployment {disclaimer}. I used ArcGIS and Adobe Illustrator to complete this.
