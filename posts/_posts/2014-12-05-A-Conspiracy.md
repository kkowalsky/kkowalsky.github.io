title: A Conspiracy of Cartographers?
---
In short: building an interactive narrative map is hard. It's tiring and frustrating and I use up way too many post it notes when brainstorming.
However, the creative process does lead to hilarious doodles. While working on my abortion map (more on the process later) for Robert Roth'sÂ Interactive Mapping course at UW-Madison, Dylan Moriarty made this hilarious doodle. The drawing, digitized by myself, is of Dylan, Robin Tolochko (with her newborn Moses) and myself in our so called conspiracy. We're not the original conspiracy (which was of Tanya Buckingham, Robert Roth, and Daniel Huffman) and certainly won't be the last.
