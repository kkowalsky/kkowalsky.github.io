I've been incredibly busy in the past 9 months (!!!) since I last blogged, my bad. In that time, I've:
- finished UW-Madison's new campus basemap
- Graduated from UW-Madison
- Moved to San Francisco
- Started working at Mapzen
- Finally beat my grandfather at Scrabble

It's been a crazy year so far, but working at Mapzen has been such a rewarding part of my year so far. One of my projects I started on earlier this year for preparation for the State of the Map US conference was to find a way to talk about how Mapzen Search, our geocoding service, works. Since the actual nuts and bolts of how a geographic search box is new to me, I made a zine!
