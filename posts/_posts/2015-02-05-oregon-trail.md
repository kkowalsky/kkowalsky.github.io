**About**

I spent a semester doing cartographic research on building a lab curriculum that covers Mapbox Studio and CartoCSS for an advanced cartographic design course at UW-Madison. This was one of the tilesets I created to serve as an example for the advanced (and whimsical) tilesets we wanted students to produce. Based off the classic 90's computer game about the Oregon Trail, I made this tileset for everyone who dared ford that river.
