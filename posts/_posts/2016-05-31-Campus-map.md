**About**

One of my last projects at the UW-Madison Cartography Lab was completely redesigning the basemap and UX interface of the campus map, initially built in Tilemill using CartoCSS. I upgraded the basemap rendering to be more efficient, created a new aesthetic for the map that reflected the mood of the concurrent marketing campaign at UW-Madison, and made recommendations for the interface look and feel.
