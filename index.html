<h1>Hello! I'm Katie. </h1>

<img src= "../assets/img/katie_new.jpg" style="width: 40%;">

<p><b>Cartographer turned Product Manager</b>, glasses-wearer, and amateur cheese enthusiast.</p>
<p>I get excited for long hikes, filling a brand new kanban board, and talking to users.</p>
<p>
I'm currently at <a href="https://www.mapzen.com">Mapzen</a> working as a Product Manager
working on improving internal development processes, user outreach, and developing product strategy.
My passion spills into everything I do, whether its talking at geospatial conferences,
running user research studies, or discovering more of San Francisco.
