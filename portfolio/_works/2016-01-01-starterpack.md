**About**

Inspired by illustrations in Vulture Magazine, I decided to turn myself into a paper doll. Using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, I digitized myself and items my friends and I consider to be my "essentials". I started this in 2014, and decided to duplicate myself again for 2015. I like to think of this as an exercise on personal branding and watching personal growth happen. These are also fun on a technical side, as I get to work on a drawing tablet and also free hand drawing on my laptop's trackpad.
