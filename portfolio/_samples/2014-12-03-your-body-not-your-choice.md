**About**

Your Body, (Not) Your Choice was a final project for my interactive cartography course. This D3 interactive map and full fledged analysis covers the changes in abortion laws at the state level since Roe v. Wade in 1973 until 2014. [Flowing Data](http://flowingdata.com/2015/03/18/abortion-policies-over-time-and-by-state/) featured this map on their blog and this map also won Honorable Mention at the [Cartography and Geographic Information Society (CAGIS)'s](http://www.cartogis.org/awards/winners2014.php) 2014 map competition. 

Learn the whole story about this map & view [Your Body, (Not) Your Choice](http://yourbodynotyourchoice.github.io/){:target="blank"} here.
