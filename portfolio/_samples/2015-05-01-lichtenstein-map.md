**About**

I've always been fascinated at the way cartography intersects art and science. So while, I developed lab curriculum on Mapbox Studio and CartoCSS for an advanced cartographic design course at UW-Madison, I wanted to test that intersection. I made a tileset is based off the work of Roy Lichtenstein, a famous pop art artist who is known for his bright primary colors, ben-day dots, and capturing a burgeoning youth culture. This was featured on the [Atlantic's City Lab blog](http://www.citylab.com/design/2015/05/the-world-mapped-as-pop-art/392729/) and the [Independent's i100 blog](http://i100.independent.co.uk/article/when-cartography-meets-pop-art-wonderful-maps-occur--g1e9ZsLcReb).
