**About**

As a cartographer and front end web developer, who identifies as a woman and a feminist, there is often a culture shock when I attend programming classes, meetups, or simply talk to my peers. While the majority of people I meet are largely supportive of the idea of increasing diversity initiatives in tech, there are some people who have preconceived notions about what that means.

I created this infographic as a way of dealing with this gender disparity. I am a huge advocate for women in technology, especially when it comes to encouraging younger generations of women to enter such a male-dominated field. This infographic actually led me to discover a lot of diversity intiatives in tech and is how I found out about Girls Who Code, a non-profit dedicated to the education of young women in computer science. After I found out about them, I spent a summer as a teaching assistant with them in Washington, DC. This project was completed with Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.
