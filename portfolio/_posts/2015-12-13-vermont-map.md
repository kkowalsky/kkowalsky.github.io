**About**

This map of Vermont was created for my family, who have lived in all the nooks & crannies of the state. Using Blender to create the terrain and ArcGIS to geoprocess the land cover, from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. After raster processing in Photoshop, I combined the rasters and vector data in Illustrator to create this map.


You can read about my process for preparing DEM for use in blender on my [blog](https://kowalskycartography.wordpress.com/2015/12/02/preparing-your-dem/).
