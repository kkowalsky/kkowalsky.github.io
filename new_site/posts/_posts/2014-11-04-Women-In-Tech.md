title: Women In Tech Infographic
---

I have experienced, and have heard horror stories from my colleagues about the awful culture that sometimes comes along with working in tech, from the classes I take and the jobs I've had in IT. This was a fun and important project to work on-- I like the challenge of creating an infographic especially when I have data that may not be best displayed as a map, and working on explaining social issues in a graphically pleasing way.
